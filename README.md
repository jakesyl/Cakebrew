The Homebrew GUI App for OS X

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew)

## About

Cakebrew does for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. With Cakebrew you can search, install, uninstall and update formulae and the Homebrew repository, all from within the app.

Do you need to use Homebrew but are afraid to use the terminal? Cakebrew is the app for you!
